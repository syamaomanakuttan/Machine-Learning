### Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Dataset

Loading the Dataset:

Load the dataset from the provided link.

Inspect the dataset to understand its structure, including the data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

Preprocessing:

Handle missing values through imputation or removal, depending on the extent of the missing data.
    
Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

Normalize or standardize the numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
    
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
    
### Step 2: Implement Regression Models

Implement the following regression algorithms:

Linear Regression:

A simple, interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable (car price).

Decision Tree Regressor:

A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, building a tree structure.
    
Random Forest Regressor:

An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
    
Gradient Boosting Regressor:

Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree trying to correct the errors of the previous one.
    
Support Vector Regressor:

A model that uses the principles of support vector machines to perform regression, effective for high-dimensional spaces.
                                                                                 
### Step 3: Model Evaluation
                                                                                 
Metrics:
                                                                                 
Evaluate the models using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
                                                                                 
Compare these metrics across all models to identify the best performer.
                                                                                 
### Step 4: Feature Importance Analysis
                                                                                 
Feature Selection:
                                                                                 
Use methods such as feature importance from tree-based models or coefficients from linear models to identify significant variables.
                                                                                 
Visualize and interpret the importance of each feature in predicting car prices.
                                                                                 
### Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
                                                                                 
Tuning:
                                                                                 
Use techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning on the models.
    
Evaluate the performance of the tuned models and compare it to the default settings.
